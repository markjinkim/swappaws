# Concept
  A client requested a web application that could connect pet owners with other pet owners to create a network.  This would be able to bypass expensive and unkept pet kennels. Similar to Coach Surfer for pets, the pet owners could trade off pet care using an in-app token currency.  A possibility to purchase tokens would monetize the service for pet owners with limitted time to provide pet care.

# Features
  The website has the ability to create user accounts that are password protected.  The user can login and view their account on the profile page.  The user can search for available time and closest sitter available for their pet and request to book the event after looking at the user's previous reviews if available.  
  
  Pet sitters can conversely create availability by making a pet sitting time.  Pet sitters can also receive requests to book from the pet owners and then  review their profiles and past reviews.
